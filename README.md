# <u> What is BEC++?</u>
BEC++ is aiming to be a fast, adaptable Gross-Pitaevskii equation solver for Bose-Einstein condensate systems.
The project is very much a work in progress. 

# <u> What can BEC++ do?</u>
BEC++ provides solvers for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation using either single-threaded CPU, multi-threaded CPU, or GPU 
accelerated using CUDA.

I plan to add support for
- [ ] Scalar BECs;
- [ ] Spin-1 BECs;
- [ ] Spin-2 BECs;
- [ ] Two-component BECs.

The codebase will also contain a myriad of useful functions for generating initial states and phase profiles that
support vortices.
